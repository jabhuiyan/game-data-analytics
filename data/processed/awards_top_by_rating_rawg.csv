About the Game
As a young journalist, you’ve been entrusted with a crucial mission: to cross the globe and reach the heart of a mysterious, faraway land…
Your goal is to bring back the last egg of the mythical “Great White Birds”. According to legend, they are bound up with the fate of the only country they call home: a land with strange, dangerous plants and wildlife that has been devastated by years of bloody dictatorship.
Amerzone - The Explorer's Legacy will call on your curiosity and observational skills as you explore its fascinating world,its magical locations and its painful history.
Solve puzzles, find clues that will help you along your way, and get immersed in the spirit of adventure, the beauty of the landscapes and the depth of the story.
During your journey, you will need to unravel the mysteries of the “hydraflot”, a fantastic invention that is equally at home in the water and in the sky. It will be your only ally to overcome the dangers standing between you and the heart of Amerzone…
First released in 1999, Amerzone is a legend in the adventure game genre.
While this remake naturally pays tribute to the original game, it also offers a totally new experience of it.
Benoît Sokal’s legacy, mingling realism and poetry, awareness of worldly truths and wonder, is both honored and magnified.
Will you manage to discover the sinister secret hidden behind the mystery of the White Birds?
In this distant land, where past and present overlap, your skills as a journalist will be your most powerful tools: make sense of the clues hidden in your environment, decipher the documents you uncover, and fulfil the explorer’s final wish by saving the Great White Birds!",Amerzone - The Explorer's Legacy,86.6,Mobile Game,rawg,amerzone - the explorer's legacy,

DRAFTING YOUR JOURNEY
Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets. But be careful how you draft, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms you saw today may not be the same rooms you see tomorrow.

Your progress each day is shaped by the rooms you select to draft and the tools you find within them. Items in the game can be used in a number of creative ways to fuel your exploration deeper into the house, allowing you to adopt unique strategies to combat the challenges that each day brings. Yet, tread wisely – the house resets each dawn, erasing all but the permanent upgrades to your estate blueprint. That is, if you were clever enough to find one!

But a race of elves known as the Sidhe resisted and were branded heretics. On the brink of losing the war, the Sidhe elders sacrificed themselves and the elven capital city to destroy the seven kings and their armies. As one of the few surviving elves, you embark on a quest for vengeance against those who slaughtered your friends, family, and entire race.Heretic: Faith Renewed [NEW]Years after the planes were cleansed of D'Sparil's wretched influence, a wandering warrior in search of home arrives at a foreign land to discover the blighted stains of that old time religion seeping through the cracks of society once more. In the fortified city, zealous acolytes stand high atop a decadent cathedral and listen to the lamentations echoing from the streets as non-believers are dragged away for 'correction.' The shadow of D'Sparil lingers after death, his absence attributed to apotheosis. Once revered, now worshipped, deserving of neither. An all-too-familiar scene, and one you simply cannot stomach. Taking up the mantle of Heretic once more, you stride into the city, staff in hand, to silence the echoes of your arch-nemesis.Hexen: Beyond HereticWhile the Sidhe elf Corvus battled the evil forces of D'Sparil, the remaining two Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. As a Warrior, Mage, or Cleric, you must fight the undead and brave elemental dungeons and decaying wilderness to defend your realm of Cronos from Korax, the second Serpent Rider.Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark CitadelAfter defeating the evil Korax, the second Serpent Rider, and discovering the Chaos Sphere, you have been transported to the Realm of the Dead. Now your only way home is blocked by hordes of undead and the Dark Citadel. Where Hexen ends, the true nightmare begins.Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur [NEW]Korax lingers between life and death, his shredded corpse left behind with no semblance of life while he clings to a fresh, if fragile, rebirth. His grip on Cronos is once more released, yet the cycle continues, proving another force is at work: an invisible hand puppeteering both Korax and you, weaving a star-crossed destiny that will never die.

I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.Undermere might seem unassuming at first – a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond – and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.Permit me now to outline your duties – you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!Study and Identify: Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.Help… Or Hinder: When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.Explore and Discover: From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumours or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.Solve and Uncover: Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.Tending the Familiar: And, of course, Jupiter, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.I look forward to your arrival.Yours,Eli WhiteThaumaturge & ProprietorStrange Antiquities, UndermerePurveyors of the Arcane since 1683We are two brothers from the UK who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game Strange Horticulture, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!Strange Antiquities is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for Strange Horticulture and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.
We want to thank everyone who has played Strange Horticulture, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way.

Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.
Wanderstop is a tea shop management ritual. Grow and harvest the ingredients needed for tea, and then mix them together in an unusual tea-making contraption. Along the way, speak with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learn their stories and make tea that’s just right for them.
In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.
And that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it... she can’t…
Wanderstop is a game from the team at Ivy Road, including Davey Wreden (creator of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide), Karla Zimonja (co-creator of Gone Home and Tacoma) and Daniel “C418” Rosenfeld (the music of Minecraft).",Wanderstop,77.2,Fighting Game,rawg,wanderstop,
