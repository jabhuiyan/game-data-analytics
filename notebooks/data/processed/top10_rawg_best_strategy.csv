About the GameAh, my glorious kingdom! A land where peasants toil, miners dig, and knights train... but only when I look at them! My gaze is law—progress thrives where I watch, but the moment I turn away? Laziness! Chaos! I must choose wisely: should I focus on the fields for food, the mines for riches, or the barracks for defense? With resources, I can even expand my all-seeing gaze, ensuring my kingdom flourishes… and that no one slacks off under my rule!Water, wheat, stone, coal, silver—every resource fuels my empire! Farms feed my people, mines fund my ambitions, and workshops forge mighty defenses. Shall I invest in archers, reinforce the walls, or harness magic? Even my castle needs repairs when the enemy strikes! Every decision shapes my reign, and only a well-managed kingdom will survive the storm.
Rulership is no easy task! Each land presents new trials, from cursed cemeteries to infernal depths, forcing me to adapt. Yet every defeat is a lesson! As a true roguelite, my efforts grant permanent upgrades, unlocking new abilities, stronger defenses, and powerful strategies for my next reign. A true king doesn’t just rule—he evolves, forging an unstoppable legacy with each attempt!
Each battlefield hides unpredictable threats—enemies are led by unexpected Generals, demanding unique tactics to defeat. Want to conquer them all? You’ll need multiple runs! But fear not! My royal council aids me with cavalry masters, arcane sages, and cunning strategists. With their wisdom—and my unwavering gaze—victory is inevitable!",84.0,the king is watching

I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.Undermere might seem unassuming at first – a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond – and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.Permit me now to outline your duties – you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!Study and Identify: Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.Help… Or Hinder: When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.Explore and Discover: From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumours or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.Solve and Uncover: Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.Tending the Familiar: And, of course, Jupiter, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.I look forward to your arrival.Yours,Eli WhiteThaumaturge & ProprietorStrange Antiquities, UndermerePurveyors of the Arcane since 1683We are two brothers from the UK who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game Strange Horticulture, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!Strange Antiquities is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for Strange Horticulture and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.
We want to thank everyone who has played Strange Horticulture, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can't wait to share the next chapter with you.Many thanks,Rob & JohnPlease wishlist and follow Strange Antiquities to stay up-to-date with the development and help us spread the word.",83.4,strange antiquities
